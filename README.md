# Unity Puzzle Games
 Collection of puzzle games, created in Unity
 
 This software is licensed under the MIT License and includes a recreation of the game Wordle in Unity called "Word Puzzle". The original game Wordle is not affiliated with nor endorsed by the author of this software.
 
 There is also the inclusion of a Sliding Images Puzzle Game called "Image Puzzle", the goal is to rearrange the pieces by sliding them around the board until the image appears normal again. The player must move the pieces in the correct  sequence to recreate the original image.

Another game called "Shape Puzzle", the player is given a set of random shapes, such as triangles, squares, and rectangles, each with a different size and orientation. The player must then arrange these shapes in a 3x3 grid in such a way that they fit together to form a perfect square.

**The games described in the previous prompts are designed to be created as projects completed in a day. As such, they may not be completely polished or finished.**
They offer an opportunity to quickly prototype and test ideas, and can serve as a starting point for further development.
